## About Me

I‚Äôm Daniel, a versatile developer with a strong focus on React and Python applications. My programming journey began in 2018 with Unity and C#, which sparked a deep passion for coding. Over time, I've channeled this passion into creating efficient and scalable web applications.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- **Backend**: Python, Node.js, Flask/Django
- **Game Development**: Unity, C#, Godot, GDScript

## Projects

- **[QueryIntelligence](https://github.com/DanielPDevelopment/AI_Y)**: I developed a robust offline AI tool that enables users to effortlessly integrate their internal documents and files. Tailored to support a wide range of both popular and niche large language models (LLMs), QueryIntelligence empowers users to effectively leverage their unique data.
- **[ControlHub](https://ofrepose.github.io/controlhubProduction/)**: I created a secure and unified platform that lets users sign in remotely to multiple servers with ease. Featuring customizable modules for popular services like PM2, Apache, Nginx, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and more, users can effortlessly control and monitor their servers from one central hub. The intuitive interface makes it easy to manage files, configure services, and optimize server performance, providing a seamless experience for all your server management needs.
- **[Ronald McDonald House Charities of Eastern NC](https://rmhcenc.org/)**: I had the opportunity to develop the website for the Ronald McDonald House Charities of Eastern NC. This project involved translating a comprehensive design packet into a fully functional, user-friendly website. The primary goal was to ensure that the website effectively communicated the organization's mission, services, and ways for the community to get involved.
- **[Docxandria](https://ofrepose.github.io/docxandria/)**: An application that simplifies access to documentation and APIs for the various systems your company uses. It listens to your conversations during client calls or meetings and intelligently fetches and displays relevant documents and APIs in real-time. This empowers you to provide immediate and accurate answers to client inquiries about your product or its ecosystem, enhancing your efficiency and professionalism.
- **[Robinson and Stith Insurance](https://www.robinsonstith.com/)**: Robinson and Stith Insurance Company needed a digital presence that would help them stand out in the competitive local market. They turned to us for a solution. Collaborating closely with our talented design team, we created a modern and visually appealing website that not only showcases their services but also enhances their brand identity. The new site features user-friendly navigation, compelling content, and a sleek design that sets them apart from the competition.
- **[IssueHub](https://ofrepose.github.io/Issue-Hub/)**: IssueHub is your streamlined gateway to finding and fixing open source issues on GitHub. Designed to simplify your contribution process, it helps you effortlessly discover, track, and resolve problems across various projects.
- **[LeadPulser](https://ofrepose.github.io/LeadPulser)**: An application that helps you get valuable insights into a business's web presence, pinpointing opportunities for improvement with detailed evaluations of SEO and accessibility. It provides easy-to-understand breakdowns of issues, allowing you to offer targeted solutions tailored to each client's specific needs. Armed with this knowledge, you can help your clients enhance their online performance and reach their goals more effectively.
- **[E2E Pulser](https://ofrepose.github.io/e2epulser/#/auth/sign-in)**: With this application I set out to streamline project dependency management. E2E Pulser keeps users informed about outdated packages and ensures application functionality through end-to-end (E2E) testing. By simplifying the process of staying up-to-date, maintaining reliable user journeys, and addressing potential issues, this application helps developers focus on building great products without worrying about the intricacies of dependency management.
- **[Logtastic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ofrepose/logtastic)**: I wanted an easy way to style my terminal logs for my Node.js backend, so I created Logtastic, a versatile npm package designed to enhance your console logging experience. With Logtastic, you can customize the appearance of your log messages with various colors, styles, and backgrounds. By integrating Logtastic into your project, you can make your terminal output more visually engaging and improve the distinction between different types of log messages.
